# Deep Agents on OCI — Operations

Part of the [Deep Agents documentation](../../langchain_oci/agents/deepagents/README.md).

## Bring your own model

```python
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_oci import create_deepagents_agent

agent = create_deepagents_agent(
    datastores={"research": store},
    model=ChatAnthropic(model="claude-opus-4-8"),
    embedding_model=my_embeddings,   # otherwise OCI auth is still needed for embeddings
)
```

- `model=` is used **as-is**; `model_id`, `temperature`, `max_tokens`,
  `**model_kwargs`, and the OCI inference auth options are all ignored —
  configure them on the model you pass.
- `compartment_id` stops being required — but is still resolved
  opportunistically because **default datastore embeddings are OCI-backed**.
  Pass `embedding_model=` to sever the last OCI dependency.
- Works with any tool-calling LangChain chat model: Anthropic, OpenAI, a
  self-hosted vLLM endpoint via `ChatOpenAI(base_url=...)`, or a
  custom-configured `ChatOCIGenAI` (e.g. kwargs the factory doesn't expose).
  The model must support tool calling; for the deep path, models with strong
  multi-step tool use work markedly better.
- Same `model=` parameter exists on `create_oci_agent`.

## Async usage & resource cleanup

- The compiled graph supports `await agent.ainvoke(...)` / `astream(...)`.
  With `ChatOCIGenAI`, native async is used where available.
- The factory attaches the built model as **`agent._oci_llm`** so long-lived
  processes can release the async HTTP session:

```python
llm = getattr(agent, "_oci_llm", None)
if llm is not None and hasattr(llm, "aclose"):
    await llm.aclose()
```

  Skipping this in long-lived async apps produces "unclosed client session"
  warnings at shutdown. With BYO models, `_oci_llm` is your model — close it
  per its own API.
- `ADB` stores hold a real DB connection: `store.close()` (idempotent) or use
  the store as a context manager.

## Sharp edges & built-in workarounds

- **`middleware=None` ≠ `middleware=[]`.** Default `None` takes the deep path;
  only the explicit empty list is the lightweight opt-out.
- **`interrupt_before/after` vs `interrupt_on`** are path-specific and
  silently unused on the other path (see the
  [parameter reference](guide.md#langgraph-options)).
- **`max_input_tokens` is accepted and ignored.**
- **Factory-time network I/O:** datastore connections and description
  embeddings happen inside `create_deepagents_agent`.
- **The pydantic/langgraph schema fallback.** Deepagents middleware annotates
  runtime-injected fields with `OmitFromSchema + NotRequired`, which pydantic
  rejects (`PydanticForbiddenQualifier`), which would crash langgraph's graph
  compilation. The factory wraps compilation in a scoped patch of
  `langgraph._internal._pydantic.create_model` that falls back to a permissive
  `Any` schema for exactly the failing model, restoring the original
  afterwards. It no-ops on langgraph versions with a different internal
  layout. If you see `langgraph schema fallback for <model>` at DEBUG level,
  this is that mechanism working as intended.
- **ADB `update()` is not transactional** (delete commits before re-insert;
  snapshot-restore on failure).
- **OpenSearch `bulk_insert` may partially succeed** — compare the returned
  count.
- **Routing selects one store per query** — multi-store coverage emerges
  across agent steps, not within one `search` call.

## Logging & observability

Component-scoped loggers, all under standard `logging`:

| Logger | Emits |
|---|---|
| `langchain_oci.datastores.vectorstores.adb.ADB` | connect/close, backend init, search requests (DEBUG), index-creation warnings |
| `langchain_oci.datastores.tools.*.HybridSearchTool` (etc.) | per-call start/success at INFO (`store=… top_k=… query=…`), failures with stack traces |
| `langchain_oci.agents.common` | schema-fallback events at DEBUG |

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger("langchain_oci.datastores").setLevel(logging.INFO)
```

For step-level agent tracing use LangSmith or
`agent.stream(..., stream_mode="updates")`; `debug=True` enables LangGraph's
debug output.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ValueError: compartment_id must be provided…` | No `compartment_id` arg, no `$OCI_COMPARTMENT_ID`, no `model=` | Pass one of the three |
| `RuntimeError: Deepagents requires Python 3.11+` | Deep path on old Python | Upgrade, or opt into `middleware=[]` |
| `ImportError: …'deepagents' package` | Deep path without the extra | `pip install 'langchain-oci[deepagents]'` |
| `ImportError: oracledb required` / `langchain-oracledb required` / `opensearch-py required` | ADB / OpenSearch store without its driver | Install the named package |
| Factory call hangs or fails before any invoke | Store connectivity (wallet path, DSN, endpoint) — connections open at build time | Test `oracledb.connect(...)` / `curl` the OpenSearch endpoint directly |
| `RuntimeError: ADB datastore is not connected` | Adapter used before `connect()` / after `close()` | Let the factory connect it, or call `connect(embedding_model)` |
| Search returns nothing relevant | Index/query embedding model mismatch, or empty table | Same model both sides; `stats` tool to check counts |
| Every query routes to the same store | Missing/similar `datastore_description`s | Distinct, content-focused descriptions |
| `get_document` "not found" for an ID seen in results | Doc lives in a non-default store | Pass `store=` — `get_document` does not route |
| Truncated final reports | Output-token ceiling | Raise `max_tokens` (e.g. 65536 on Gemini 2.5 Pro) |
| `Unclosed client session` warnings | Async model client never closed | `await agent._oci_llm.aclose()` |
| Slow `get`/`delete` on ADB at scale | `metadata.id` index couldn't be created (check warning log) | Create the function-based index manually |
| `ORA-00955` in logs | Index already exists | Benign — silently handled |
| Deep path + Gemini model 400s: `Unknown name "exclusiveMinimum" at 'tools[0]...'` | `deepagents>=0.7` ships a built-in `grep` tool whose `max_count` field (`gt=0`) emits `exclusiveMinimum`, which Gemini's function-declaration API rejects (verified live 2026-08) | Fixed by [#291](https://github.com/oracle/langchain-oracle/pull/291) (Gemini provider rewrites the bounds). On releases without it: use a non-Gemini model on the deep path (e.g. `meta.llama-3.3-70b-instruct` — verified working), pin `deepagents<0.7`, or use the lightweight path (`middleware=[]`) with Gemini |

## Testing

```bash
cd libs/oci
# Unit (no credentials; deepagents/langgraph mocked where needed)
poetry run pytest tests/unit_tests/agents/test_deepagents.py tests/unit_tests/agents/test_datastores.py -q

# Integration (real OCI GenAI + optional ADB/OpenSearch)
export OCI_COMPARTMENT_ID=... OCI_REGION=... OCI_AUTH_TYPE=API_KEY OCI_CONFIG_PROFILE=DEFAULT
poetry run pytest tests/integration_tests/agents/test_deepagents_integration.py -v
```

Unit tests double as behavior specs —
`test_empty_middleware_uses_lightweight_agent`,
`test_backend_forces_deep_agent_path`,
`test_custom_model_skips_compartment_requirement`, etc.
